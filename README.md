# PokerHandParser
Poker hand history parser

Draft of a poker hand history parser currently kind of working for Poker Stars tournaments.

Needs refactoring, documenting & the BO model & builder to be passed from the client.

Feed PokerHandHistoryParser.parse() a line at a time.  It returns a Hand object every time one is completely built.

See TestParser for an example of how to use.
